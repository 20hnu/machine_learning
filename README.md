# Machine Learning Notebooks

## Overview
This repository contains chapter-wise Jupyter notebooks from the book **"Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Keras"** by Tim Cooper (O'Reilly). These notebooks serve as study material and hands-on practice while learning AI/ML concepts from the book.

## Features
- **Chapter-wise implementation** of key ML concepts
- Covers **Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Keras**
- Practical examples and exercises
- Useful for beginners and intermediate learners in Machine Learning

## Installation
To run the notebooks, install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow keras matplotlib jupyter
```

## Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the desired chapter:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/20hnu/machine_learning.git
cd machine_learning
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebook of your choice and execute the cells to explore the concepts.

## Topics Covered
The repository follows the chapters of the book, covering:
- **Fundamentals of Machine Learning**
- **Supervised Learning (Regression & Classification)**
- **Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)**
- **Deep Learning with TensorFlow & Keras**
- **Neural Networks and CNNs**
- **Word2Vec Implementation**
